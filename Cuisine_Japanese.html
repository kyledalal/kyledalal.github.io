	Japanese cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional foods of Japan, 
	which have developed through centuries of social and economic changes. The 
	traditional cuisine of Japan (和食 washoku?) is based on rice with miso soup 
	and other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. Side dishes 
	often consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. 
	Seafood is common, often grilled, but also served raw as sashimi or in sushi. 
	Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light batter, as tempura. 
	Apart from rice, staples include noodles, such as soba and udon. Japan also 
	has many simmered dishes such as fish products in broth called oden, or beef 
	in sukiyaki and nikujaga. Foreign food—in particular Chinese food like ramen, 
	fried dumplings, and gyōza—as well as foods like curry and hamburgers are 
	commonly found in Japan. Historically, the Japanese shunned meat, but with 
	the modernization of Japan in the 1880s, meat-based dishes such as tonkatsu 
	became common. Japanese cuisine, particularly sushi, has become popular 
	throughout the world. As of 2011, Japan overtook France in number of 
	Michelin-starred restaurants and has maintained the title since.
